Upon opening the website, three login portals are displayed: User Login, Admin Login, and Vendor Login.
Users can log in as regular users through the User Login portal.
Vendors can log in via the Vendor Login portal.
Admin Portal:

Clicking on the Admin Login portal allows access for administrators.
To log in as an admin, use the following credentials:
